This is the GitHub repository of the Perpetually Incomplete Internet Index (or pi3), a listing of useful webapps, websites, and computer programs from around the web.

This project exists purely out of personal interest; I will **not** take money to list your fancy Web 3.0 widget (so don't even ask).
